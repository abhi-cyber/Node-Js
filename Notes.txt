Important points:-

1. Node is used to build server side app.
2. When working on Node you have no access to browser API's like DOM, Window, etc.
3. Unlike other frameworks, in Node we are not required to update our node in existing projects which save our app from crashing.
4. Node evaluates your code using either REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) or CLI (MAIN).

# REPL 

1. To use REPL write the following code in the terminal :-- node
2. Here you can create variables, add nos., etclike in js.
3. Ctrl+C ---> To exit the node command prompt.
